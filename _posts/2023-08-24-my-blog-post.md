## This is my first blog post

So, my first entry is about what I think about being a data scientist. What do I see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  What differences/similarities do I see between data scientists and statisticians?  How do I view myself in relation to these two areas?
A data scientist collects, analyzes and interprets the data. These insights can help big organizations and companies to make decisions about problems at hand.  The data used by data scientists can be structured or unstructured, and therefore, they use statistical analysis and computations to prepare the raw data for data analysis. Designing data modelling processes and creating algorithms is also part of their job to find and analyze the data.

To be a data scientist, you certainly need a set of skills and some of them are as follows:
- Strong knowledge of Python, SAS, R, Scala
- Hands-on experience in SQL database coding
- Ability to work with unstructured data from various sources like video and social media
- Understand multiple analytical functions
- Knowledge of machine learning

Also, the specific data scientist duties can include:
- Collecting and cleansing data
- Integrating and storing data
- Preparing data for analysis by transforming it to fit a standard format
- Experimenting with different machine learning models
- Automating data collection and integration processes
- Writing software programs to perform analysis
- Interpreting analysis results and discussing them with interested parties
- Staying updated with industry developments

Data Scientists and statisticians share one brain cell. Both statisticians and data scientists work closely with data. I would say that statisticians would develop their own experiments, design methods to collect the data, that could be from surveys, experiments, and so on. The data collected through these methods requires cleaning, pre-processing. Once that is done, statisticians can put on their data scientist hat, and start applying statistical methods, interpret results from the analyses. Both data scientists and statisticians need expertise in statistical analysis, their knowledge of programming, data visualization skills, and knowledge of machine learning. In order to gather, organize, and analyze data, the interdisciplinary area of data science uses components of computer science, mathematics, and technology. 

Data scientists may concentrate on related technologies like software engineering, automation, and machine learning. In comparison, statistics is a more established subfield of mathematics. However, statisticians are more likely to concentrate on mathematical ideas like significance testing, diagnostic charts, and manual data collecting. They may employ technology to accomplish their objectives.

Data scientists focus on using data to solve real-world problems, while statisticians focus on analyzing data and developing statistical models.Data scientists often work with huge, complicated datasets and employ a variety of tools and technologies, including machine learning techniques, data visualization software, and programming languages such as Python and R. Statisticians utilize statistical software such as R and SAS, although they mostly employ more classic statistical procedures such as regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and analysis of variance.

Where do I see myself in relation to these two areas? This is a tough one. I think I started as a statistician but now I can see myself being a data scientist too. I don't have any background in computer programming or data analysis but I think these are some necessary skills to have. I am glad that I can comfortably try doing at least half of the work of a statistician. I now understand why people enjoy it, at least I am enjoying it. This topic and field has become a part of my research now or I would say my research wont be completed if I dont know this topic. So yeah, glad to be on the journey of being at least one of them (Statistician or Data scientist).
