This blog is basically my journey in this class ST558. It is definitely fun to be able to do blogging. I might find an alternative career option here. So stay tuned.

I am a PhD Student in Textile Technology and Apparel Management Program of Wilson College of Textiles.

Being an international student sometimes can be overwhelming, so I am trying to record bits and pieces for my life here in US, you check my page on [instagram](https://instagram.com/idreamofunicornsandsunshine?igshid=OGQ5ZDc2ODk2ZA==) for it.

Please feel free to reach out if you wish to connect.
And lets hope we do well in this class :+1:
