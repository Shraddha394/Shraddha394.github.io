**Something about me**
I am a PhD Student in Textile Technology and Apparel Management Program of Wilson College of Textiles.

Being an international student sometimes can be overwhelming, so I am trying to record bits and pieces for my life here in US, you check my page on [instagram](https://instagram.com/idreamofunicornsandsunshine?igshid=OGQ5ZDc2ODk2ZA==) for it.
